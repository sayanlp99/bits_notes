### Class Notes: Software Quality Assurance and Testing (CS5 & CS6)

#### 1. **Five Distinct Levels of Testing**
   - **Debugging**: The process of correcting a failure in the software.
   - **Demonstration**: Showing that the major features of the software work with typical inputs.
   - **Verification**: Finding as many faults as possible in the application under test (AUT).
   - **Validation**: Finding faults in the requirements, design, and the AUT.
   - **Prevention**: Avoiding errors during the development of requirements, design, and implementation using self-checking techniques.

#### 2. **Software Testing Equation**
   - **Software Testing = Software Verification + Software Validation**
     - **Verification**: Involves evaluation, reviews, inspections, and desk checks of work products (like requirement specifications, design specifications, and code). It asks: *Are we building the product right?*
     - **Validation**: Evaluating the software during or after development to ensure it meets the specified requirements by running the actual software. It asks: *Are we building the right product?*

#### 3. **Classification of Software Testing**
   - **Based on Testing Concept**: Software testing can be categorized based on different concepts, each applied in different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
   - **Based on Requirements**: The classification of testing can also be driven by the requirements, focusing on validating whether the software meets the outlined needs.

#### 4. **V-Model in Software Testing**
   - **Definition**: The V-Model is an SDLC model where testing execution occurs in a hierarchical manner, forming a V-shape. It integrates both **Verification** and **Validation** at each stage of the development cycle.
     - **Key Characteristics**:
       - Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.
       - Verification phases (like design validation) are on one side of the V, while validation phases (like functional testing) are on the other side.
       - The coding phase is in the center, connecting the two sides.
     - **Difference from Other Models**: Unlike the **Waterfall model**, where testing is only a post-development activity, and the **Spiral model**, which tests increments separately, the V-model emphasizes that testing applies at every stage.

#### 5. **Test Terminology**
   - **Test**: The act of exercising software with test cases to uncover errors, faults, or failures.
   - **Test Case**: A specific scenario with inputs and expected outputs designed to test particular behaviors of the software.
   - **Test Suite**: A collection of test scripts or test cases aimed at verifying the functionality within a product, for example, an acceptance test suite.
   - **Test Script**: Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to execute a test case, potentially including multiple test cases.

#### 6. **Categorizing Verification & Validation (V&V) Techniques**
   - **Black-Box Testing (Functional Testing)**:
     - Treats the software as a "black box," meaning the internal structure is not visible to the tester.
     - The tester only knows the inputs and expected outputs without understanding how the software transforms inputs into outputs.
     - Suitable for testing based on functional specifications without knowledge of the code.

#### 7. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**
   - **Concept**: BVA is a black-box testing technique that assumes the likelihood of defects is higher at the boundaries of input ranges.
   - **Approach**: Test cases are created using input variable values at their minimum, just above the minimum, nominal, just below the maximum, and at the maximum. (E.g., `{min, min+, nom, max-, max}`)
   - **Single Fault Assumption Theory**: This theory holds that while testing, only one variable should be pushed to its extreme at a time, with all others held constant, maximizing the number of test cases needed for thorough coverage.
     - For **n** variables: Maximum of `4n + 1` test cases.

#### 8. **Additional Testing Concepts**
   - **Verification Phases**: These involve steps like requirement verification, design verification, and code verification, ensuring each phase aligns with its expectations before moving to the next.
   - **Validation Phases**: These steps involve functional validation and system validation, focusing on ensuring the developed system functions as per the requirements.

#### 3. **Regression Testing**:
   - A type of testing that ensures that new code changes do not adversely affect the existing functionalities of the application. It’s often automated for efficiency.

#### 4. **Exploratory Testing**:
   - A simultaneous learning and testing approach, where testers explore the application in real-time without predefined test cases. It helps uncover hidden issues not found in scripted tests.

#### 5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - A software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. Developers write tests for every small functionality, and development focuses on making the tests pass.

#### 6. **Automation Testing**:
   - **Automation** helps to speed up regression tests and repetitive testing tasks. Tools like **Selenium** and **JUnit** allow for automated functional and unit tests.

### Summary
This lecture elaborates on **Verification and Validation (V&V)**, various **testing models** like the **V-Model**, and detailed test-related terminologies such as **test cases**, **test suites**, and **test scripts**. Emphasis was placed on the importance of using structured techniques like **Black-box Testing** and **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** to ensure comprehensive testing. Understanding the interplay between **Verification** and **Validation** is crucial for ensuring high software quality throughout the development lifecycle.

### Class Notes: Software Quality Assurance and Testing

#### 1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**
   - **Concept**: BVA is a testing technique that focuses on testing input values at their boundaries since errors are more likely to occur at these points.
   - **Example**: Consider a program that determines the previous date. For input variables like **Day**, **Month**, and **Year**, test cases are designed using the minimum, just above minimum, nominal, just below maximum, and maximum values.
     - For n variables, the maximum number of test cases required is `4n + 1`.
     - Example for a system that accepts ages from 18 to 56:
       - **Valid Test Cases**: Input values like 18, 19, 37, 55, 56.
       - **Invalid Test Cases**: Input values like 17, 57.

#### 2. **Equivalence Class Testing**
   - **Motivation**: The goal of equivalence class testing is to:
     - Perform exhaustive testing.
     - Avoid redundancy in testing (unlike BVA, which can result in redundant tests).
   - **Process**: The input and output domains are divided into finite equivalence classes. A single representative from each class is selected for testing.
     - The assumption is that if one representative from a class finds an error, the entire class is considered erroneous. If no error is detected, the entire class is considered correct.
   - **Types of Equivalence Class Testing**:
     1. **Weak Normal Equivalence Class Testing**: Single variable testing from each equivalence class, assuming a single fault.
     2. **Strong Normal Equivalence Class Testing**: Multiple fault assumption, testing all possible combinations of inputs.
     3. **Weak Robust Equivalence Class Testing**: Testing for both valid and invalid values, using one variable from each class.
     4. **Strong Robust Equivalence Class Testing**: Tests all valid and invalid inputs from the product of the equivalence class, though it does not reduce redundancy.

#### 3. **White-Box Testing**
   - **Definition**: White-box testing involves testing the internal structure and flow of the program. The tester has access to the source code and can test internal paths, branches, loops, and conditions.
   - **Purpose**: To verify the program code, code structure, and internal design flow, ensuring the program logic works as expected.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Statement Coverage**: Ensures that each line of code is executed at least once.
     - **Path Coverage**: All possible paths through the program are executed.
     - **Condition Coverage**: Tests all possible outcomes of each logical condition.
     - **Function Coverage**: Ensures that each function or method is called during testing.

#### 4. **Code Coverage Testing**
   - **Definition**: Code coverage measures how much of the code is covered during testing by designing and executing test cases.
   - **Instrumentation of Code**: This technique is used to measure the percentage of code covered by tests. Different levels of coverage include:
     - **Statement Coverage**
     - **Path Coverage**
     - **Condition Coverage**
     - **Function Coverage**
   - The goal is to ensure that the maximum percentage of the code is covered by tests to reduce the risk of untested code causing issues later.

### Additional Information for Better Understanding

#### 1. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) Enhancements**
   - **Critical Fault Assumption**: BVA works best when applied under the assumption that a single fault exists. For complex applications with multiple faults, combining BVA with equivalence class testing can yield more robust results.
   - **Real-World Application**: BVA is particularly useful in scenarios where inputs are constrained by specific limits, like form validation (age ranges, date input, etc.).

#### 2. **Equivalence Class Testing Enhancements**
   - **Weak vs. Strong Equivalence Testing**:
     - **Weak Normal**: Focuses on a single fault in the system, ideal for simpler test scenarios.
     - **Strong Normal**: Accounts for multiple possible faults, providing better coverage in complex systems.
   - **Robust Testing**: By adding invalid test cases in weak and strong robust equivalence testing, testers can anticipate and handle edge cases more effectively.

#### 3. **White-Box Testing and Automation**
   - **Automating White-Box Testing**: Tools like **JUnit** and **Mockito** can be used to automate unit tests for internal code structure, ensuring that even minor changes to code don’t introduce bugs.
   - **Code Refactoring**: Regularly performing white-box testing helps identify areas in the code that can benefit from refactoring, improving maintainability and reducing technical debt.

#### 4. **Code Coverage vs. Functional Coverage**
   - **Code Coverage**: Focuses on ensuring that the internal code paths, branches, and logic are tested.
   - **Functional Coverage**: Ensures that all functions, as per the specifications, are tested. Both are essential for a thorough testing process.
   - **Combining Coverage Techniques**: While high code coverage is important, combining it with functional coverage ensures both the logic and functionality of the application are adequately tested.

### Summary
This lecture covers key techniques like **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**, **Equivalence Class Testing**, and **White-box Testing**. The importance of **code coverage** testing is also discussed, with methods such as statement, path, condition, and function coverage. Testing techniques like **weak/strong normal equivalence class testing** and their robust counterparts help ensure that software handles both valid and invalid inputs effectively.
