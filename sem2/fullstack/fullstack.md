### Web Protocols (Module 3)

---

### **1. Introduction to Web Protocols**
- **Web Protocols** are essential for client-server communication on the internet.
- This module covers important web protocols such as HTTP, HTTP methods, headers, connection management, and communication between frontend and backend.

---

### **2. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
- **HTTP Request-Response Model**:
  - HTTP is a unidirectional protocol where the client (browser) initiates requests, and the server responds.
  - Request and response both have headers and body sections.
  
- **Request Structure**:
  - Method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, HTTP version.
  - Headers: Name-value pairs providing additional context (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`).
  - Body (optional): Data sent with the request (for POST, PUT).

- **Response Structure**:
  - Status line (HTTP version, status code, reason phrase).
  - Headers: Provide metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`).
  - Body: The resource or data being returned.

---

### **3. HTTP Methods**
- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
- **POST**: Submits data to the server, often changing its state.
- **PUT**: Replaces all current data at the target URL.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Partially modifies a resource.
- **OPTIONS**: Describes communication options for the resource.
  
---

### **4. Fetch API & Axios**
- **Fetch API**:
  - A modern interface for making HTTP requests from the client.
  - Uses the `fetch()` method, which returns a Promise.
  - Can be configured to handle different HTTP methods and headers.
  
- **Axios**:
  - A popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.
  - More user-friendly than Fetch, with built-in JSON parsing.
  - Can be used for both browser-based and Node.js HTTP requests.

**Key Differences**:
- Fetch API is built-in and doesn't require external dependencies.
- Axios needs to be installed but simplifies handling and transformations (e.g., JSON data).

![22](22.png)

---

### **5. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication**
- **Synchronous Communication**: The client waits for the server to finish processing before proceeding (e.g., typical form submissions).
- **Asynchronous Communication**: The client can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the server response (e.g., AJAX).

![23](23.png)

---

### **6. Long-Running Transactions**
- If a server task exceeds a typical request timeout, it often returns a **202 Accepted** response, indicating that the request is still being processed.
- Common techniques to handle long-running tasks:
  - **Polling**: The client checks the server at regular intervals for updates.
  - **Webhooks**: Server sends a notification to the client when the task is complete.
  - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Server pushes updates to the client.
  - **WebSockets**: Full-duplex communication between client and server.

---

### **7. Communication Techniques**
- **HTTP Polling**:
  - The client makes repeated requests at set intervals, waiting for a server response.
  - Servers return either the requested resource or an empty response.
  - **Headers**: 
    - `Location`: The URL the client should poll.
    - `Retry-After`: Informs the client when to poll again.
  
  ![24](24.png)

- **Webhooks**:
  - Event-driven, HTTP-based callbacks.
  - The server sends data to the client only when an event occurs (no need for the client to poll).
  - Uses HTTP POST to send a payload to the client's webhook URL.

  ![25](25.png)

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**:
  - A unidirectional channel where the server sends real-time updates to the client.
  - The client connects using the **EventSource** API and listens for messages.
  - Common in live dashboards, notifications, or live feeds.

- **WebSockets**:
  - Provides bidirectional communication over a single TCP connection.
  - Allows real-time, full-duplex communication, ideal for chat applications, gaming, etc.
  - Uses a handshake protocol to upgrade from HTTP to WebSockets (via headers like `Upgrade` and `Sec-WebSocket-Key`).

  ![26](26.png)

---

### **8. Summary of Communication Methods**
- **Polling**: Client initiates repeated requests.
- **Webhooks**: Server initiates communication after an event.
- **SSE**: Server sends updates over a single HTTP connection.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time, bidirectional communication over a persistent connection.

### Client-Side and Server-Side in Web Communication

#### **Client-Side**
- **Definition**: The client-side refers to operations that are performed by the userâ€™s device (browser, mobile app) when interacting with a server. 
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - The **client-side application** (e.g., frontend like React JS or AngularJS) sends requests to the server via HTTP protocols.
  - The **client-side** often cannot directly implement advanced techniques like Webhooks because they require a server to handle incoming HTTP POST requests.
  - **Pure frontend applications** (like React, Angular) cannot directly receive webhooks; instead, webhooks need a backend server to listen for events from the server.
  
- **Usage**:
  - Client-side applications make HTTP requests using **Fetch API** or **Axios** to retrieve data from the server or interact with APIs.
  - These client-side apps rely on server-side APIs to receive data asynchronously or synchronously.

#### **Server-Side**
- **Definition**: The server-side refers to operations carried out by the server in response to requests from the client. It includes handling business logic, database interactions, and providing resources back to the client.
  
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - The **server-side** runs server-based logic, processes requests, and sends responses to the client.
  - For communication like Webhooks, the server is responsible for receiving HTTP POST requests that are triggered by events from other systems.
  
- **Webhooks**:
  - In Webhooks, the **server-side** application sets up a URL (a webhook) that receives the POST request from another system when an event occurs.
  - When the event happens (e.g., a payment being completed), the event information is sent to the **server-side** webhook.
  
- **Full-Duplex Communication**:
  - **WebSockets**: The server and client engage in bidirectional communication over a persistent connection. 
  - The **server-side** handles real-time updates and pushes them to the client.

### **Use Cases**
- **Fetch API & Axios**: Ideal for making HTTP requests in client-server applications, such as fetching data or submitting forms.
- **Polling**: Useful when there is no other way for the client to be informed of a change.
- **Webhooks**: Best for applications needing notifications on specific events (e.g., payments, status changes).
- **SSE**: Great for live dashboards, news feeds, and live sports scores.
- **WebSockets**: Suited for real-time applications like chats, gaming, and live collaboration tools.
