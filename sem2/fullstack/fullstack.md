- Cloud provider executes the function, abstracting the execution process from developers.
- **Examples**:
  - **AWS**: AWS Lambda
  - **Microsoft Azure**: Azure Functions
  - **Google Cloud**: Cloud Functions

#### Serverless Benefits and Drawbacks
- **Benefits**:

  - Vendor lock-in
  - Multitenancy problems
  - Security concerns

#### AWS Serverless Offerings
- **AWS Lambda**: Run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **AWS Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale.

#### Reference Architecture: Web Application
- **General-purpose, event-driven web application backend**:
  - **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon API Gateway** for business logic
  - **Amazon DynamoDB** as the database
  - **Amazon Cognito** for user management
  - **AWS Amplify Console** for hosting static content

### Layered Pattern
- **Context**: Separation of concerns.
- **Problem**: Ensuring that system modules are independently developed and maintained, promoting portability, modifiability, and reuse.
- **Solution**: Dividing software into units called layers, where each layer is a cohesive set of services.
  - **Interaction**: Strict unidirectional ordering.
  - **Interface**: Each partition is exposed through an interface.

---

### Web Application Architecture
- **Layered Architecture**: Fundamental structure for web applications.
  - **Two-Layer Systems**: Client-server systems where the client holds the user interface and application code, and the server hosts a relational database.
  - **Three-Tier Architecture**:
    - **Presentation (UI)**: User interface components.
    - **Business Logic**: Core functionality and business rules.
    - **Data Access**: Interaction with the database.

---

### Ensuring Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Scenario 1**: Highlight products with over 10% increase in sales.
  - **Method 1**: Embed logic directly into the presentation layer.
  - **Method 2**: Use a method in the domain layer to indicate improved sales, then call this method from the presentation layer.
- **Scenario 2**: Adding a command-line interface to a web application.
  - **Method**: Avoid duplicating functionality by properly separating layers, ensuring domain logic does not leak into the presentation.

- **Definition**: Divides application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.
  - **Model**: Manages data-related logic and interacts with the database.
  - **View**: User interface, communicates with the controller, and renders data.
  - **Controller**: Handles user input, processes requests, and manages data flow to the view.
- **Example**:
  - Routes: `/users/profiles/:id`
  - Controller: Fetches user profile and renders the view.
  - Model: Queries the database for user data.
  - View: Displays user profile information.

---

---

### Model-Template-View (MTV)
- **Definition**: Similar to MVC but with a distinct template component.
  - **Model**: Interface for data.
  - **Template**: Presentation layer, containing static or dynamic HTML.
  - **View**: Executes business logic and interacts with the model, rendering the template.

### Web Application

### **1. Client-Server Pattern**
- **Context:** Shared resources and services accessed by multiple clients.
- **Problem:** Managing shared resources efficiently while promoting modifiability and reuse.
- **Solution:** Clients send requests for services to servers, which manage and provide these services. Some components can act as both clients and servers.

**Key Points:**

- **Server:** Provides services/resources.
- **Client:** Requests services/resources.
  
**Benefits:**
- **Higher Security:** Centralized control improves security.
- **Centralized Data Access:** Data is managed centrally, making it easier to update and control.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Centralized systems are easier to maintain than distributed ones.

### **2. Variants of Client-Server Pattern**
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Applications:** Each node acts as both a client and server.
- **Application Servers:** Provide services to client applications.
- **Asynchronous Requests:** Clients donâ€™t block while waiting for data.
- **Server-Initiated Actions:** Servers can initiate actions on clients in some scenarios.
